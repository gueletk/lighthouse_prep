			<p>I first saw this recipe in an amazing cookbook I can't recall the name of. This was so long ago that I was taking this book out of the library and photocopying the recipes. This dessert has a couple of things going for it: the very strong lemon flavour, the lack of any baking, and the ease with which you can adapt it to any container you want.</p>

			<p>The most difficult part of this recipe is the patience that's required to fold the lemon mixture into the whipped cream/egg white masses. As I rediscovered the first time I made this after a <strong>long</strong> hiatus, just dumping the parts together and hoping for the best will end up with the lemon juice leaking out of the springform pan and onto the bottom of your freezer because the liquid doesn't get incorporated into the fluffy mix of egg whites and whipping cream. Although the result was still delicious, I would recommend some patience in the last leg of this recipe.<i class="fa fa-facebook" id="facebook"></i> </p>

			<p><span class="highlight">Grind vanilla wafers in food processor until fine crumbs.</span> Stir in melted butter until combined. Press mixture onto bottom of 9-inch spring form pan. This can be replaced with a package of vanilla Pirouline (tube wafers filled with cream) - these are similarly crushed and pressed evenly onto the bottom of the pan.</p>
			<p>In large bowl, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon zest. In stainless steel bowl, beat egg whites until light and foamy Add cream of tartar and salt; beat until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining sugar until stiff peaks form.</p>
